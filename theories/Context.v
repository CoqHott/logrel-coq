Definition context := list term.

Notation "'ε'" := (@nil term).
Notation " Γ ,, d " := (@cons term d Γ) (at level 20, d at next level).
Notation " Γ ,,, Δ " := (@app term Δ Γ) (at level 25, Δ at next level, left associativity).

(** States that a definition, correctly weakened, is in a context. *)
Inductive in_ctx : context -> nat -> term -> Type :=
  | in_here (Γ : context) d : in_ctx (Γ,,d) 0 (d⟨↑⟩)
  | in_there (Γ : context) d d' n : in_ctx Γ n d -> in_ctx (Γ,,d') (S n) (ren_term shift d).

Lemma in_ctx_inj Γ n decl decl' :
  in_ctx Γ n decl -> in_ctx Γ n decl' -> decl = decl'.
Proof.
  induction 1 in decl' |- * ; inversion 1 ; subst.
  1: reflexivity.
  now f_equal.
