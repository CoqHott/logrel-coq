(* Map reduces as expected on canonical forms of lists *)
Check mapNil.

Check mapComp.


(* ** Presentations of the typing judgements *)

(* The development employs 3 different presentations of the typing judgements
  for MLTT: 
  - declarative presentation;
  - algorithmic presentation;
  - mixed with algorithmic conversion and declarative typing.

  These presentations all fit into a common interface called the generic typing
  and employed to parametrize the logical relation and the fundamental lemma.
