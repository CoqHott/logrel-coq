Once Coq is properly setup (see REQUIREMENTS.md), you can simply issue `make` in the root folder and browse the proof with your favourite Coq IDE:
```
make
```

Alternatively, instructions for using a docker container are provided in DOCKER.md.

For easiness, the html documentation built using `coqdoc` is included in the artefact. It can be built again invoking
```
make coqdoc
```
